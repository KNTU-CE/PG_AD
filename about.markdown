Algorithms are the soul of computing. Algorithmic thinking, unlike the very young electronic machinery it brings
alive, is rooted in ancient mathematics. It can be roughly described as creating "recipes" (well defined sequences
of computational steps) for getting "things" (computational problems specifying an input-output relation)
"successfully" (correctly) "done" (in finite steps and time). This course introduces basic methods for the design
and analysis of efficient algorithms emphasizing methods useful in practice. Different algorithms for a given
computational task are presented and their relative merits evaluated based on performance measures. The
following important computational problems will be discussed: sorting, searching, elements of dynamic
programming and greedy algorithms, advanced data structures, graph algorithms (shortest path, spanning trees,
tree traversals), string matching, elements of computational geometry, NP completeness.
